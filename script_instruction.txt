Goal:
    --> level up the acount (solve task)

    how to do it?

        --> Check for existing solution in google

    Logic:

    1 -->  Open Browser, Login and go to main CheckIO page.
    2 -->  Get info about all islands links
    3 --> Go on the link from X island.
    4 --> Get all info about all tasks from current island. (Titles,links,and if_solved)
    5 --> Go to the link of task and find a solution of a task.
    6 --> go to task url + /solve/ + paste solution.
    7 --> Click Check:
        7.1 --> Task solved --> move on the next task(repeat algorithm)
        7.2 --> task not solved -> Go to point 5 (5 tries MAX , then skip)
    8 --> if all tasks are solved from island or skipped then go to point 2
